# Ring Buffer Performance Benchmark Report

## Executive Summary

This benchmark report evaluates the performance of a custom lock-free ring buffer implementation against industry-standard Crossbeam channels. The custom ring buffer demonstrates superior performance in both throughput and latency metrics, making it an excellent choice for high-frequency trading systems and other low-latency applications.

## Test Configuration

- **Buffer Size**: 10,000 slots
- **Messages per Test**: 100,000 messages
- **Test Data**: `MarketUpdate` struct (symbol, price, size, timestamp)
- **Hardware**: MacBook Air M4
- **Framework**: Criterion.rs

## Start To Bench

```bash
cargo bench --bench bench_ring_buffer
```
